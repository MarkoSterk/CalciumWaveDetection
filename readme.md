A simple algorithm for Ca2+ wave detection in acute pancreatic tissue slices
based on the binarized Ca2+ activity of beta cells in Islets of Langerhans
recorded with high spatio-temporal resolution confocal laser scaning microscopy.

Example binarized beta cell activity data is in the 'Fbinsig.txt' file with corresponding
cellular coordinates in the 'Fkoordinate.txt' file. 

Fbinsig.txt --> array like structure with shape (number of recorded frames, number of cells)
Fkoordinate.txt --> array like structure with shape (number of cells, 2): x, y coordinates
